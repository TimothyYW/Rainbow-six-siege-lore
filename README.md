# UX

The purpose of this site is to entertain and to educate the user with Rainbow six siege development and lore, this includes trailers from the previous update and the comics from the game developer Ubisoft. By utilizing Youtube videos embedded on each years and seasons, it will provide the user with entertainment and help the user to understand the lore and the developement.

The font I used is Bebas neue for the logo and heading, since I found it closely resembled the original logo of rainbow six siege. As can be seen below:

![Rainbow Six Siege logo](assets/images/Tom_Clancy's_Rainbow_Six_Siege_Logo.jpg)

For the paragraph font style Exo 2 is used, but it is similarly to the theme of rainbow six siege and easy to read, combining with white color, allowing words to appear simple and keep-up with the theme.

The color scheme will be using black and white to simplfy and stick with old classic Rainbow six siege color. The header will be using the color black and white to make it easier to navigate, while the main section will be using both background pictures and the grey color to keep up with theme. The use of background images as for decoration and to give the looks of the member of rainbow six siege.

The wireframes for the home, games, and newletter can be viewed below:

![Newsletter page](assets/screenshots/wireframe-three.jpg)

The sketches are used to ensure the structure of the website, but as can be seen the games page has been simplfied to fi all the images in the read me.md.

During coding for games.html when creating the timelines, I put too much content within which caused it to be lag. to fixed it, I moved all the content into eight seperate html.
